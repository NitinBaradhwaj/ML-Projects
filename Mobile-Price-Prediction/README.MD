# Mobile-Price-Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Description:

Comparisons of different machine learning algorithms predicting mobile price_range with 13 different attributes.

The maximum accuracy is 96.25%, achieved using the SVM (with linear kernel) classification algorithm.



## To install required external modules
* Run `pip install pandas` 
* Run `pip install numpy` 
* Run `pip install seaborn`
* Run `pip install matplotlib`
* Run `pip install sklearn`


## Machine Learning Library In Python3
Numpy , Pandas , sklearn, Seaborn, Matplotlib


## Algorithms used:

### 1. KNN (K Nearest Neighbor):
The k-nearest neighbors algorithm, also known as KNN or k-NN, is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point. While it can be used for either regression or classification problems, it is typically used as a classification algorithm, working off the assumption that similar points can be found near one another.

### 2. Decision Tree:
Decision Tree is the most popular tool for classification and prediction. A Decision tree is a flowchart-like tree structure, where each internal node denotes a test on an attribute, each branch represents an outcome of the test, and each leaf node (terminal node) holds a class label. 

### 3. Logistic Regression:
Logistic regression estimates the probability of an event occurring, such as voted or didn't vote, based on a given dataset of independent variables. Since the outcome is a probability, the dependent variable is bounded between 0 and 1.

### 4. SVM (Support Vector Machine):
Support Vector Machine(SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression. Though we say regression problems as well its best suited for classification. The objective of SVM algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that distinctly classifies the data points.
